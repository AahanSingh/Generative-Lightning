# Generating realistic Monets
The dataset used in this repo is from the Kaggle Competition [I’m Something of a Painter Myself](https://www.kaggle.com/c/gan-getting-started/overview). The challenge is to train a GAN to generate realistic looking Monets from photographs. The dataset contains 300 images of Monets and 7038 image of real life photographs. The dataset contains square RGB images of dimension 256. 
The first set of experiments are inspired by [Amy Jang's Notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/amyjang/monet-cyclegan-tutorial). While Amy's tutorial uses tfrecords and keras to create and train the CycleGAN, my aim was to try and replicate that using [Pytorch Lightning](https://www.pytorchlightning.ai/). In order to userstand the flow of data through the network, ultimately ending in the calculation of the losses, I created the diagram below. While it may look complex, the idea is quite simple when broken down into smaller steps.

## Instructions:
- To run training: `python train_model.py --gpus 1 --data-path data/raw/ --bs 128 --log_every_n_steps 10`

## Need to fix:
- [] WideResnetEncoder and Decoder don't work. Need to change function signatures of conv_upsample and downsample to new ones.
- [] WideResnetUnet code needs cleaning.
